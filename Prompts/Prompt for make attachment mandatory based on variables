Here's a ServiceNow GenAI prompt to generate code that makes an attachment mandatory based on a variable's value:

ServiceNow GenAI Prompt:

"Generate a client-side script for a ServiceNow catalog item form that makes file attachments mandatory based on the value of a choice variable. If the user selects 'Yes' from the choice variable (e.g., variable name: 'attachment_required'), the system should prevent form submission and display an error message unless an attachment has been added."


---

This prompt will help the Generative AI generate a client-side script (likely JavaScript/GlideForm) that can be added to your catalog item for enforcing this condition.

Alternatively, here's a sample script you can use directly:

Sample Client Script (onSubmit)

function onSubmit() {
    var attachRequired = g_form.getValue('attachment_required');  // 'attachment_required' is the variable name
    if (attachRequired == 'Yes') {
        var attachments = g_form.getAttachments();
        if (attachments.length == 0) {
            g_form.addErrorMessage('Attachment is mandatory when you select "Yes". Please attach a file before submitting.');
            return false;  // Prevent form submission
        }
    }
    return true;
}

Variable Name: Change 'attachment_required' to match the actual name of your variable.

Condition: Adjust the if (attachRequired == 'Yes') part if you have different options for the variable.


This will display an error and prevent the form submission if there are no attachments when the user selects "Yes" in the specified choice field.
