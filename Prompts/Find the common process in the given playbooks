I am a playbook designer and automation developer in ServiceNow. I want to find out the and abstract the playbooks to make some automation process reusable in process automation designer. To make the flow/automation reusable, please also make them into subflow or action in flow designer.

For example, indentify the abstraction point in the following 2 playbooks.

Playbook 1

1. EDR detected some abnormal activity and create a notable event in the ticketing system.
2. Analyst found the activity to be malicious and perform a file hash blokcing on the EDR solution.
3. Infected endpoint would require reimage. Kick off rebuild endpoint process for MS endpoint.

Playbook 2

1. An phishing alert ticket with a user clicked on phishing link detected.
2. Analyst found the URL in the message body to be malicious and perform a proxy blocking and email sender blocking in Email security service.
3. User credential compromised and would require a password reset in Azure AD. Kick off password reset process for Auzre AD.
