Hi, Generate an incident report for all the groups I am part of. Include only the incidents assigned to my groups and organize the report in a tabular format with columns: Incident Number, Short Description, State, Priority, Assignment Group, and Created Date. Ensure the report includes both active and resolved incidents, sorted by Created Date in descending order."

Sample Output:
Incident Number	Short Description	State	Priority	Assignment Group	Created Date
INC0012345	Login issue	Active	2 - High	IT Support	2024-10-10 14:35:00
INC0012344	Network outage	Resolved	1 - Critical	Network Team	2024-10-09 16:20:00
INC0012343	Software installation failure	Resolved	3 - Medium	Application Support	2024-10-08 11:15:00

INC0012341	Email service disruption	Resolved	2 - High	Email Team	2024-10-06 15:45:00
