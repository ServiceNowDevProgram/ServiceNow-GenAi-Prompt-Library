### Prompt for Creating a Business Rule to Auto-Close Resolved Incidents

**Prompt:** Develop a Business Rule that automatically changes the state of incidents to "Closed" if they have been in the "Resolved" state for more than 7 days. This will help in maintaining a clean incident table and ensuring timely closure of resolved incidents.

**Structure:** Outline the steps to create the Business Rule, including the conditions and script logic for closing incidents.

---

### Expected Output:

1. **Navigate to Business Rules:**
   - Go to **System Definition > Business Rules** in ServiceNow.
   - Click on **New** to create a new Business Rule.

2. **Configure Business Rule Properties:**
   - **Name:** Auto-Close Resolved Incidents
   - **Table:** Incident [incident]
   - **Active:** True
   - **Advanced:** True (to write a script)

3. **Set When to Run:**
   - **When:** After (to ensure the rule runs after the record has been saved)
   - **Insert:** False (we donâ€™t want this to trigger on insert)
   - **Update:** True (it should trigger on updates)

4. **Set Conditions:**
   - **Condition:** 
   ```javascript
   current.state == 'Resolved' && current.resolved_at <= gs.daysAgo(7)
   ```
   - This condition checks if the incident is in the "Resolved" state and whether the resolution date is more than 7 days old.

5. **Script Logic:**
   - Add the following script in the **Script** field:

```javascript
// Automatically close incidents that have been resolved for more than 7 days
current.state = 'Closed';
current.update(); // Save the change
gs.info('Incident ' + current.number + ' has been auto-closed after being resolved for over 7 days.');
```

6. **Testing:**
   - Create a few test incidents and resolve them.
   - Wait for more than 7 days and check if the incidents automatically change to "Closed."
   - Monitor the system logs for the info message indicating the incident closure.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Document the Business Rule in the ServiceNow application documentation, including its purpose and any necessary operational notes for administrators.
