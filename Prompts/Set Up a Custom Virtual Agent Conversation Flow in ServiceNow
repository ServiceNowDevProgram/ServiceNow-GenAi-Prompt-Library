Create dialog nodes: Walk me through building dialog nodes that provide relevant responses based on the identified intents, including prompts, questions, and conditional responses.
Integrate backend services: Show me how to connect the conversation flow to backend systems or services, retrieving and displaying data dynamically based on user input (e.g., querying records, checking status).
Test and optimize the flow: Provide guidance on testing the conversation flow in the Virtual Agent Simulator to ensure accuracy, completeness, and user satisfaction.
Improve user experience: Offer best practices for making the conversation flow intuitive, responsive, and effective, ensuring minimal user confusion and improving engagement.
