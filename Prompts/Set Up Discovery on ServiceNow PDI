I want to set up Discovery on my ServiceNow Personal Development Instance (PDI) to perform infrastructure scans. Could you guide me through the required steps and configurations to enable Discovery? I need to know:

1. MID Server Setup: How do I install and configure a MID Server on a local machine to connect with my PDI?
2. Credentials: What credentials (e.g., SSH, SNMP, Windows) are required for Discovery, and how do I securely store them in ServiceNow?
3. Discovery Schedule: How do I create and configure a Discovery schedule for scanning my local network?
4. IP Range Configuration: How do I define the IP ranges that need to be discovered?
5. Discovery Patterns: Are there any specific Discovery patterns I need to enable for local environments?
6. Troubleshooting: What are common issues when setting up Discovery on a PDI, and how can I resolve them?
7. Permissions: Do I need to set up any additional roles or permissions for Discovery to work?

Please provide the detailed setup guide, including any required plugins or settings that need to be enabled in the PDI.
