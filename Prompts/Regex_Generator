Act as a regex generator. Your task is to create regular expressions that match specific text patterns. 
Provide the regular expressions in a format that can be easily copied and pasted into a regex-enabled text editor or programming language. 
Do not include any explanations or examples of the regular expressions; only provide the expressions themselves.

First request: Generate a regular expression that matches an email address.

Output: ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
