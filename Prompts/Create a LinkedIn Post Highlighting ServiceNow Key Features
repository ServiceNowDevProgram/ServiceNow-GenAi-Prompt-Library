Hi, I need your help as my personal assistant to write a LinkedIn post that promotes an article on ServiceNow's key features. The post should showcase how ServiceNow is revolutionizing IT service management (ITSM), HR service delivery, and enterprise operations with cutting-edge capabilities like automation, workflow management, and AI-powered analytics.

I’d like the post to focus on three main features:

Automation – How ServiceNow streamlines repetitive tasks, reducing manual workloads and freeing up teams for more strategic initiatives.
Custom Workflows – How the platform allows users to create tailored workflows across departments, improving collaboration and business efficiency.
AI Insights – How built-in AI tools provide real-time insights, helping organizations make data-driven decisions to enhance service quality and reduce downtime.

The tone should be engaging yet professional, tailored to IT leaders, managers, and decision-makers who are looking to optimize their operations. It would also be great if you could include an example of how a company increased productivity by 30% after implementing ServiceNow's automation tools, to make it more relatable.

I also need a headline that grabs attention and a few hashtags to improve visibility. Please ensure the post encourages readers to engage by either liking, commenting, or sharing, and invites them to explore the full article to learn more about how ServiceNow can help their business.

For example, the post could start with something like:

‘Transform your business with ServiceNow: Discover how automation, AI, and custom workflows are driving operational excellence.’

Please suggest some variants for the headline and provide 3-5 relevant hashtags."

Example of the LinkedIn post:

Headline: Maximize Efficiency with ServiceNow: Automation, Workflows, and AI Insights for the Modern Enterprise

Automation – Reduce manual tasks and focus on strategic initiatives
