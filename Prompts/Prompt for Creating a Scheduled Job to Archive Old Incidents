### Prompt for Creating a Scheduled Job to Archive Old Incidents

**Prompt:** Develop a scheduled job that archives incidents older than one year into a separate archive table to keep the incident table manageable. The job should ensure that all relevant data is transferred, and the original incidents are deleted from the active incident table.

**Structure:** Outline the steps to create the scheduled job, including the script logic for archiving incidents.

---

### Expected Output:

1. **Navigate to Scheduled Jobs:**
   - Go to **System Definition > Scheduled Jobs** in ServiceNow.
   - Click on **New** to create a new scheduled job.

2. **Configure Scheduled Job Properties:**
   - **Name:** Archive Old Incidents
   - **Active:** True
   - **Run:** Periodically (set to run daily, weekly, etc. as per your organizationâ€™s requirements)

3. **Set the Schedule:**
   - Use the **Run** field to specify when the job should execute (e.g., daily at midnight).

4. **Script Logic:**
   - Add the following script in the **Script** field:

```javascript
// Create a GlideRecord for the incident table
var grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');
grIncident.addQuery('sys_created_on', '<=', gs.daysAgo(365)); // Incidents older than 1 year
grIncident.query();

while (grIncident.next()) {
    // Create a new record in the archive table
    var grArchive = new GlideRecord('incident_archive'); // Assume this is your archive table
    grArchive.initialize();
    grArchive.short_description = grIncident.short_description;
    grArchive.description = grIncident.description;
    grArchive.state = grIncident.state;
    grArchive.assigned_to = grIncident.assigned_to;
    grArchive.resolved_at = grIncident.resolved_at;
    // Add other necessary fields as required
    grArchive.insert(); // Insert the archived record

    // Delete the original incident
    grIncident.deleteRecord();
    gs.info('Archived and deleted incident: ' + grIncident.number);
}
```

5. **Testing:**
   - Create several test incidents with different created dates.
   - Run the scheduled job manually to test the archiving process.
   - Verify that old incidents have been archived correctly and deleted from the active table.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Document the scheduled job in the ServiceNow application documentation, including its purpose, schedule, and impact on incident management.
