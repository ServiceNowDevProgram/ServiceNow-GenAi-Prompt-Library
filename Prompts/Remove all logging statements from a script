Prompt for removing all logging statements from a script.

PURPOSE
This prompt would assist developers who use logging statements to troubleshoot issues but forget to remove them from scripts before moving to production.

PROMPT
Review the JavaScript code in <INSERT RECORD HERE> and remove all logging statements that use the gs.log, gs.info, gs.debug, gs.logError and gs.logWarning functions.
Provide the updated script back to me, identifying where logging statements have been removed.
