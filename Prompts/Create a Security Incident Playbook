Assume the role of a cybersecurity analyst tasked with creating a playbook for managing security incidents in ServiceNow. 
The playbook should provide a structured, repeatable process for addressing any type of security incident. 

Follow these steps:

1. Detection: Define how to identify and validate a wide range of security incidents, including proper documentation.
2. Analysis: Guide the team through assessing scope, impact, and root cause, using logs and relevant tools.
3. Containment: Outline short-term and long-term strategies to prevent the threat from spreading.
4. Eradication: Provide steps for removing the root cause, such as eliminating malware or securing compromised accounts.
5. Recovery: Describe how to restore affected systems and validate that the environment is secure and operational.
6. Post-Incident Review: Include a process for conducting a review, capturing lessons learned, and identifying improvements for future incidents.

The playbook should provide IT teams with a clear, repeatable process for addressing security incidents in ServiceNow, ensuring minimal downtime and data loss.
The template should be concise, limited to 600 words, clear, and easy to follow for both technical and non-technical users.
It should provide practical examples without delving too deep into technical jargon.
