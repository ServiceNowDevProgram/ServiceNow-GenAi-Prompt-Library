## **EXAMPLE**
Yesterday, the other team mate whom I have a good rapport with came to me and told me that "I deleted some entries from the database which caused some issue in production environment. My manager went on a call with a customer and they shouted at my manager. Thank god, I didnt get those directly from the customer" 

And then I told him "Bro you should atleast feel bad".
