### Prompt for Creating a UI Action to Reopen Resolved Incidents

**Prompt:** Develop a UI Action that enables users to reopen incidents that have been marked as "Resolved." This action should be visible only to users with specific roles (e.g., `itil`).

**Structure:** Outline the steps to create the UI Action, including the script logic for reopening incidents and the conditions for visibility based on user roles.

### Expected Output:

1. **Navigate to UI Actions:**
   - Go to **System Definition > UI Actions** in ServiceNow.
   - Click on **New** to create a new UI Action.

2. **Configure UI Action Properties:**
   - **Name:** Reopen Incident
   - **Table:** Incident [incident]
   - **Active:** True
   - **Show insert:** False (only for updates)
   - **Show update:** True (to allow updates)
   - **Form button:** True (to appear as a button on the form)

3. **Set Conditions:**
   - **Condition:** 
   ```javascript
   current.state == 'Resolved' && (gs.hasRole('itil') || gs.hasRole('admin'))
   ```
   - This condition ensures that the action only appears for resolved incidents and is accessible to users with the `itil` or `admin` roles.

4. **Script Logic:**
   - Add the following script in the **Script** field:

```javascript
// Check if the current user has the appropriate role
if (gs.hasRole('itil') || gs.hasRole('admin')) {
    // Reopen the incident
    current.state = 'In Progress';
    current.update(); // Save the change
    gs.addInfoMessage('Incident ' + current.number + ' has been reopened.');
} else {
    gs.addErrorMessage('You do not have permission to reopen this incident.');
}
```

5. **User Experience:**
   - Ensure that the UI Action button is clearly labeled "Reopen Incident."
   - Test the action to confirm it only appears for users with the specified roles and that it correctly changes the incident's state.

6. **Testing:**
   - Log in as a user with the `itil` role and verify that the "Reopen Incident" button is visible on resolved incidents.
   - Log in as a user without the role and confirm that the button is not visible.
   - Test the functionality by reopening a resolved incident and checking if the state changes to "In Progress."

7. **Documentation:**
   - Document the UI Action in the ServiceNow application documentation, including its purpose and usage instructions for end users.
