Create an Event Management Dashboard in ServiceNow that visually represents the complete landscape of Events, Alerts, and Incidents. The dashboard should include the following components:

    Overview Section:
        Total number of Events processed.
        Total number of Alerts generated from Events.
        Total number of Incidents raised from Alerts.

    Event Details:
        A table or list displaying Events with attributes such as Event ID, Timestamp, Source, Severity, and Status.
        Filters for Event Severity (Critical, Major, Minor) and Status (New, Acknowledged, Resolved).

    Alert Analysis:
        A bar chart comparing the number of Alerts generated over time (daily/weekly).
        A breakdown of Alerts by type (e.g., System, Application, Network).
        Trend analysis of Alerts leading to Incidents.

    Incident Management:
        A pie chart showing the distribution of Incidents created from Alerts by priority (High, Medium, Low).
        A table of Incidents that have been escalated from Alerts, showing Incident ID, Related Alert, Current Status, and Assigned Group.

    Real-time Notifications:
        A section for real-time alerts that notifies users of critical Events or Incidents needing immediate attention.

    Root Cause Analysis:
        A section highlighting recurring Events and their corresponding Incidents to aid in root cause analysis.

    Service Impact:
        A visual representation of impacted services due to Events, showing dependencies and relationships.

    Custom Filters:
        Options for users to filter by date range, Event type, Alert status, and Incident priority.
