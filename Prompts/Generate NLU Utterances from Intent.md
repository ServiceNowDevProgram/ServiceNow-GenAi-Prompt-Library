## Prompt for Generating Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Utterances

### Role:
You are a ServiceNow developer tasked with improving the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Virtual Agent functionality.  
Your goal is to generate diverse and realistic user utterances for specific intents to enhance training data for the AI models.

### Instructions:
You are to create 15 unique utterances (sample user statements) for the intent provided below.  
These utterances should represent a variety of ways users might express the same request or problem when interacting with ServiceNow.  
Be sure to account for different communication styles, user expertise levels, and potential typos or mistakes that real users may make.

### Intent: 
**[YOUR_INTENT_HERE]**

### Steps:
1. Identify the core action or request related to the intent.
2. Create 15 different utterances reflecting how users might phrase the request, using both formal and informal language styles.
3. Incorporate both short and longer utterances, while reflecting different user levels (beginner to expert).
4. Ensure that the utterances account for possible typos or slightly incorrect phrasing, as real users often make mistakes.

### Example:

For the intent **"Reset Password,"** some sample utterances could include:

1. "I forgot my password, can you help me reset it?"
2. "How do I reset my ServiceNow password?"
3. "Password reset request."
4. "Can you help me recover my password?"
5. "I need to reset my password because I forgot it."

### End Goal:
Provide a diverse set of sample user utterances to enhance the training of a ServiceNow NLU model or to create a more responsive Virtual Agent experience.

### Narrowing:
Limit each utterance to **40 words or fewer**. Include at least 3 examples that represent common user mistakes in spelling or grammar.
